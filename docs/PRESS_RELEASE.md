## Gay Run Club Launches Enhanced Platform Features to Improve Community Engagement

**Miami Beach, FL** - Gay Run Club, the community event management platform for coordinating and managing running club events for the LGBTQ+ community, today announced a series of exciting platform enhancements designed to improve user experience and community engagement.

### New Features and Improvements

The latest update introduces several key features that make organizing and participating in runs easier and more engaging:

**Run Titles**
Pacers can now give their runs descriptive, memorable names, making it easier for runners to identify and share events. This feature helps create a stronger sense of community and makes runs more discoverable.

**Enhanced Mobile Experience**
The platform now features a fully responsive mobile navigation system with an intuitive hamburger menu, ensuring seamless access to all features on smartphones and tablets. All interfaces have been optimized for touch interaction.

**Quick Reference Guides**
Inline, collapsible quick guides are now available directly on each page, providing users with instant access to step-by-step instructions without leaving their current task. This feature reduces friction and helps both new and experienced users navigate the platform more efficiently.

**Advanced Reporting Tools**
Administrators now have access to comprehensive reporting features:
- **Run Report**: A detailed, sortable table view of all runs with multiple sorting options including city, creation date, scheduled date, pacer name, and status
- **Runners Report**: Participation statistics tracking runner engagement, including number of runs attended and diversity of pacers they've run with

**Social Sharing Enhancements**
Signup links now include Open Graph meta tags, automatically generating rich preview cards when shared on social media platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook. This makes it easier for runners to identify and share runs with their networks.

**Privacy and Transparency**
Enhanced privacy notices clearly communicate how user data, particularly phone numbers, is used, ensuring transparency and building trust within the community.
