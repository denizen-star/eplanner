# Guide for Activity Coordinators: Creating an Event

Welcome to the Event Planner platform! This guide will walk you through the process of creating and managing an event. As an activity coordinator, you'll coordinate events for our community, and this platform makes it easy to organize, share, and manage your events.

## Overview

When you create an event, you'll receive two important links:
- **Signup Link**: Share this with attendees so they can register for your event
- **Management Link**: Keep this private - use it to view who has signed up

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Navigate to the Coordinate an Event Page

1. Open your web browser and go to the Event Planner website
2. On desktop: Click on **"Coordinate an Event"** in the navigation menu at the top of the page

**Note**: The platform is fully mobile-friendly. On mobile devices, you'll see a hamburger menu icon (☰) in the top right corner. Tap it to access the navigation menu.

## Tips for Successful Event Coordination

### Before Creating Your Event

- **Plan ahead**: Create your event at least a few days in advance to give attendees time to sign up
- **Choose a good location**: Pick a location that's easy to find and accessible for all attendees
- **Set realistic limits**: Consider your ability to manage the group when setting max participants
- **Check the weather**: While you can't control it, be aware of forecasted conditions

### After Creating Your Event

- **Share early and often**: Post your signup link multiple times as the event date approaches
- **Monitor signups**: Check your management link regularly to see how many people have signed up
- **Communicate with attendees**: Consider creating a WhatsApp group for the event to coordinate details
- **Be prepared**: Arrive early to the location and be ready to welcome attendees

### Best Practices

- **Be inclusive**: Welcome attendees of all backgrounds and experience levels
- **Safety first**: Ensure the location is safe and well-lit if the event is in the evening
- **Have a backup plan**: Know what to do if weather conditions are unsafe
- **Stay organized**: Keep track of who's coming using your management link

## Troubleshooting

### The map isn't showing my location correctly

- Try entering a more specific address
- Include city and state in your location description
- Check the validated address shown - it may be more accurate than what you typed

### I can't find my management link

- Check your browser history - the link should be there after you create the event
- If you're an administrator, you can also find your event in the Admin Dashboard and access the management link from there

### The form won't submit

- Make sure all required fields (marked with *) are filled out
- Check that your date/time is in the future
- Ensure your max participants is a number greater than 0
- Verify your location is valid (the map should show it)

### I need to change event details after creating it

- If you're an administrator, you can edit events through the Admin Dashboard
- Otherwise, you may need to create a new event with the corrected information
