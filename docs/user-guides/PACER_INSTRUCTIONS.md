## Tips for Successful Run Coordination

### Before Creating Your Run

- **Plan ahead**: Create your run at least a few days in advance to give runners time to sign up
- **Choose a good location**: Pick a location that's easy to find and safe for running
- **Set realistic limits**: Consider your ability to manage the group when setting max participants
- **Check the weather**: While you can't control it, be aware of forecasted conditions

### After Creating Your Run

- **Share early and often**: Post your signup link multiple times as the run date approaches
- **Monitor signups**: Check your management link regularly to see how many people have signed up
- **Communicate with runners**: Consider creating a WhatsApp group for the run to coordinate details
- **Be prepared**: Arrive early to the location and be ready to welcome runners

### Best Practices

- **Be inclusive**: Welcome runners of all skill levels
- **Safety first**: Ensure the route is safe and well-lit if running in the evening
- **Have a backup plan**: Know what to do if weather conditions are unsafe
- **Stay organized**: Keep track of who's coming using your management link

## Troubleshooting

### The map isn't showing my location correctly

- Try entering a more specific address
- Include city and state in your location description
- Check the validated address shown - it may be more accurate than what you typed

### I can't find my management link

- Check your browser history - the link should be there after you create the run
- If you're an administrator, you can also find your run in the Admin Dashboard and access the management link from there

### The form won't submit

- Make sure all required fields (marked with *) are filled out
- Check that your date/time is in the future
- Ensure your max participants is a number greater than 0
- Verify your location is valid (the map should show it)

### I need to change run details after creating it

- If you're an administrator, you can edit runs through the Admin Dashboard
- Otherwise, you may need to create a new run with the corrected information
