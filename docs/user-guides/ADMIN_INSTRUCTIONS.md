# Guide for Administrators: Managing Events

Welcome to the Event Planner Admin Dashboard! This comprehensive guide will help you manage all aspects of events, from creating new events to viewing signups and managing participants. As an administrator, you have full access to all events and can perform administrative tasks to keep the platform running smoothly.

## Overview

The Admin Dashboard provides you with:
- A complete view of all events (past and future) in collapsible sections
- Ability to create new events
- Edit existing event details
- View signups for any event
- Copy signup and management links
- Delete events
- Remove individual signups
- **Event Report**: View and sort all events with detailed statistics
- **Participants Report**: View participant participation statistics and engagement metrics

This guide will walk you through each of these features in detail.

## Accessing the Admin Dashboard

1. Navigate to the Event Planner website
2. On desktop: Click on **"Admin"** in the navigation menu at the top of the page
3. On mobile: Tap the hamburger menu (☰) icon, then tap **"Admin"**
4. You'll see the Admin Dashboard with collapsible sections

**Note**: The Admin Dashboard is organized into collapsible sections that you can expand or collapse as needed:
- **Admin Dashboard**: Main event management interface

## Admin Dashboard Section

The main Admin Dashboard section contains the event management interface. Click on the **"Admin Dashboard"** section header to expand it.

### Viewing All Events

The Admin Dashboard displays all events in a compact list format. Each event shows:

- **Location**: Where the event is taking place
- **Event Title**: The optional title given to the event (if provided by the planner)
- **Planner Name**: The person organizing the event
- **Date & Time**: When the event is scheduled
- **Signups**: Current number of signups vs. maximum participants (e.g., "5 / 10")
- **Status**: "Open" (spots available) or "Full" (no spots remaining)

Events are sorted by date/time, with the newest events appearing first.

### Understanding the Event List

- **Green "Open" badge**: The event still has spots available
- **Red "Full" badge**: The event has reached its maximum capacity
- Each row is clickable and contains action buttons

## Creating a New Run

You can create a new run directly from the Admin Dashboard:

1. Expand the **"Admin Dashboard"** section if it's collapsed
2. Click the **"Create New Run"** button at the top of the dashboard
3. This will take you to the "Coordinate a Run" page
4. Follow the same process as pacers (see the Pacer Instructions guide for detailed steps)
5. After creating the run, you'll be returned to the Admin Dashboard where you can see your new run

[SCREENSHOT: "Create New Run" button in the Admin Dashboard section]

**Note**: Creating a run from the Admin Dashboard works exactly the same as when pacers create runs. You'll receive signup and management links just like any other pacer.

## Viewing Run Details and Signups

For each run in the list, you can view detailed information and signups:

### Viewing Links

1. Click the **"Links"** button on any run row
2. A dropdown will expand showing:
   - **Signup Link**: The public link for runners to register
   - **Management Link**: The private link for the pacer to manage signups
3. You can click on either link to open it, or click the **"Copy"** button to copy the link to your clipboard

### Viewing Signups

1. Click the **"Signups"** button on any run row
2. A dropdown will expand showing a list of all registered runners

## Editing a Run

You can edit any run's details directly from the Admin Dashboard:

1. Click the **"Edit"** button on the run you want to modify
2. The run row will expand to show an edit form
3. You'll see a map showing the current location (if available)
4. Fill in or modify the following fields:
   - **Location**: Update the run location (the map will update as you type)
   - **Pacer Name**: Change the pacer's name
   - **Date and Time**: Modify the scheduled date and time

5. Review the changes, especially the location on the map
6. Click **"Save Changes"** to update the run
7. Or click **"Cancel"** to discard your changes

**Important Notes:**
- Editing a run does not affect existing signups
- If you reduce the max participants below the current number of signups, the run will show as "Full" but existing signups remain
- The signup and management links remain the same after editing

## Copying Links

You can easily copy links for any run:

1. Click the **"Links"** button on a run
2. In the dropdown, you'll see both the Signup Link and Management Link
3. Click the **"Copy"** button next to the link you want to copy
4. A confirmation will appear that the link has been copied to your clipboard
5. You can now paste the link wherever you need it (WhatsApp, email, etc.)

**Use Cases:**
- Share the signup link with runners if the pacer needs help distributing it
- Provide the management link to a pacer who lost their original link
- Copy links for documentation or communication purposes

## Deleting a Run

If you need to remove a run from the system:

1. Click the **"Delete"** button on the run you want to remove
2. A confirmation dialog will appear asking: "Are you sure you want to delete this run? This action cannot be undone."
3. Click **"OK"** to confirm deletion, or **"Cancel"** to keep the run

**Warning**: Deleting a run is permanent and cannot be undone. All signups associated with that run will also be deleted.

**When to Delete:**
- A run was created by mistake
- A run needs to be cancelled and removed from the system
- Cleaning up old or expired runs

**Alternative**: Instead of deleting, you could edit the run to change the date or other details if you just need to modify it.

## Managing Individual Signups

While you can view signups from the Admin Dashboard, to delete individual signups you'll need to:

1. Click the **"Signups"** button to view the list of signups
2. Click on the **Management Link** for that run (or use the "Links" button to get it)
3. This will take you to the run management page
4. Expand the "Signups" section
5. Click the **"Delete"** button next to the runner you want to remove
6. Confirm the deletion

## Tips for Administrators

### Daily Management

- **Check regularly**: Review the dashboard daily to monitor run activity

### Best Practices

- **Coordinate when needed**: Use the dashboard to coordinate between multiple pacers and runs

### Data Management

- **Regular cleanup**: Periodically review and delete old or cancelled runs
