# Marketing Copy (Canonical)

Use this file as the **single source of truth** for EventPlan messaging. It is written to match the current product language:

- **Event** (not “run”)
- **Coordinator** (not “pacer”)
- **Participant** (not “runner”)

## 1) One-liner (website hero / meta description)

EventPlan helps communities create and manage events with signup links, participant tracking, and a clean admin experience.

## 2) Short paragraph (website “About”)

EventPlan is a lightweight event coordination platform built for fast setup and simple sharing. Coordinators create an event, share a signup link, and manage participant details in one place—without complicated tooling.

## 3) Feature bullets (only claim what we actually do)

- Create events with date/time, location, capacity, and optional details
- Share signup links and collect participant signups
- Admin tools to review events, signups, and manage tenants (subdomains/branding)
- Email notifications (when enabled) for key actions like event creation and signups

## 4) Press blurb (very short)

EventPlan is a simple event coordination platform that helps organizers publish events, share signup links, and manage participant signups—fast.

## 5) WhatsApp / social caption (copy-paste)

We’re using EventPlan to coordinate upcoming events.

- Coordinators: create an event and share the signup link
- Participants: sign up in seconds

Want the link? Reply here and we’ll send it over.

## 6) Terms / naming (keep consistent)

- **Event**: the core unit (created by a coordinator)
- **Coordinator**: creates/manages an event
- **Participant**: signs up / attends
- **Tenant**: a subdomain + branding configuration (if using Tenant Manager)
